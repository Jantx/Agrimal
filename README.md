# Agrimal
Software Solution designed to improve the efficiency of agricultural and livestock management. Its main goal is to centralize and automate administrative, production, and operational processes within a farm, enabling better control over resources, livestock, crops, and financial operations through real-time data and analytical insights.

The project is built with Python (FastAPI) for the backend, Next.js + TailwindCSS for the frontend, and uses PostgreSQL as the relational database. It follows a monolithic architecture, optimized for deployment on a Raspberry Pi, ensuring efficiency and flexibility for small to medium-scale agricultural operations.

Agrimal aims to become an essential tool for the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, promoting sustainability, process traceability, and data-driven decision-making.
